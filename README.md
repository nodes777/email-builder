# Email Builder

This is a wrapper around [Unlayer](https://unlayer.com/) with the save and export features as buttons. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Unlayer-React](https://github.com/unlayer/react-email-editor). I made this to facilitate my wildlife photography "Hikelights" project.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Issues

- Cannot select a font in the unlayer drop down
- The html exported does not correctly format the text color - a semi colon is missing
- The save and export buttons always pop up a browser window
- CTRL+S won't save because the save of a design is inside an iFrame
